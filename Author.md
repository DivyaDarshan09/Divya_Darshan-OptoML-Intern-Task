**My experience aligns strongly with `ASIC and SoC Design`, as highlighted below:**

## Relevant Experience

1. **India RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD – IIT Gandhinagar)**  
- Selected among **3,500+ applicants**, I completed the full **ASIC design flow** for a RISC-V SoC using **Synopsys tools** and the **SCL 180nm PDK**, gaining hands-on exposure to RTL-to-GDSII.

2. **1-TOPS RISC-V SoC Program (VLSI Society of India)**  
- Our team was selected among **37 teams out of 550+ proposals** nationwide. We are currently designing a **low-power RISC-V–based biomedical SoC**, focusing on system architecture and power-efficient design.

3. **Shakti C-Class RISC-V Processor (IIT Madras / CEG Fabless)**  
- Implemented and optimized a **Tournament Branch Predictor** using **Bluespec Verilog**, strengthening my understanding of **processor microarchitecture and performance trade-offs**.

4. **Custom 8-bit Accumulator-Based Processor**  
- Designed and verified a custom **8-bit accumulator processor** and successfully **taped it out on the efabless platform**, gaining real **silicon validation experience**.

## Notes

This repository was created as part of a practical RTL exercise for an internship application. The focus is on correctness, clarity, and clean engineering practices.
